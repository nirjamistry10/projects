Business Analytics Projects

These are all the business analytics projects/coding assignments I engaged in through my first semester in the MS in Business Analytics program. These projects 
highlight my competencies in carrying out analyses and building prediction models using Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression. Furthermore, it also 
includes analyses I ran to evaluate the said models and pick the models that perform the best. Additionally, I also work on some transformation and feature engineering to 
prepare my data for all the assignments. 

The final project - Red Wine Quality Prediction Model - brings together all of these techniques I have learned through the semester to put it together and build a recommendation
model for red wines based on different features such as its acidity, pH level, sulfur dioxide levels, etc. In this project, I engaged in feature engineering to create a new 
variable called 'Molecular Sulphur Dioxide' that recognizes the relationship between sulphur dioxide amounts in a wine and the pH level of the wine. This interaction variable 
increases complexity in the model but it also improves the model vastly when using models that are tolerant of complexity. Lastly, I also balanced the target variable 'Wine 
Quality' as it was imbalanced in terms of class distributions and used ROC and AUC to evaluate the model for its efficacy.
